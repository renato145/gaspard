# Gaspard

> Gaspard is a Python library that wraps Google's Gemini API to provide a higher-level interface for creating AI applications. It automates common patterns while maintaining full control, offering features like stateful chat, prefill support, image handling, and streamlined tool use.

Things to remember when using Gaspard:

- You must set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable with your Gemini API key
- Gaspard is designed to work with multiple Gemini models (including for example `gemini-1.5-pro` and `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` ).
- The library provides support for tool calling and various forms of media including images.
- Use `Chat()` for maintaining conversation state and handling tool interactions
- When using tools, the library automatically handles the request/response loop
- Gaspard supports various media types: images, audio files, video files, PDF documents, etc..
- Gaspard's API design is similar to Claudette (for Anthropic's Claude model) and Cosette (for OpenAI's models)
